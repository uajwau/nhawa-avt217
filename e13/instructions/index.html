    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Open xd</li>
      <li>Create an artboard that has a width of 448px and a height of 399px.</li>
      <li>Using the rectangle tool, create two rectangles that are 176px in width and 258px in height.</li>
      <li>Place them next to each other, dragging them down until the pink lines on either side of the artboard are 25px away from the edge of each shape (like, the margins).</li>
      <li>When you drag them down a line should also appear to help center them in the artboard.</li>
      <li>The number on the pink line between the two rectangles should be 50.</li>
      <li>Once this is done, create another rectangle that’s the same size, and drag it to the middle, in between the two first rectangles, but drag it lower so that the pink line for the third rectangle reads 100, and don’t worry about it whether it is in front of the other rectangles or not.</li>
      <li>Fill this box with your favorite color and make sure the border of the rectangle is the same color as well.</li>
      <li>Fill the other two boxes with two other colors you think would look nice with your favorite color, they can be different shades of your favorite color or different ones, and be sure to make their borders the same color as well.</li>
      <li>Export the artboard as a png, name it whatever you’d like.</li>
      <li>Email me the png.</li>
      <li>Thank you!</li>
